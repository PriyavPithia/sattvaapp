I want to build a user authenticated app with the following features:
    - User can sign up and login
    - User can create, read, update and delete a knowledegbase
    - All the knowledegbases will be stored in a database
    - The knowledegbases will include several file types which are Youtube videos, user upload videos, user upload audios, real time speech to text, pdf, pptx, doc, txt.
    - User can also upload the file and it will be added to the knowledegbase.
    - We will extract the text from the file types and store the text in the database. This will be the context for our Knowledegbase.
    - User can ask questions about the knowledegbase and we will use Open AI API, chat gpt 3.5 turbo, to answer the questions.
    - Answers will be recieved with reference points from the particular file the text is from stored in the database and shown on the chat interface.
    - On the chat interface, user can see the chat history and the answers.
    - The page also has a section to select the file and view the context and for youtube video we will show the video player.
    - The Text in the context will be highlighted and autoscrolled and for youtube video player it will automatically play it from the timestamp of the reference points.
